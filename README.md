# WordPress-HTML-Share-Buttons
These share buttons are simple HTML and CSS with some php to retrieve the post title. These buttons can be customized and shared even used in commercial products. If there is a share button that you want that is not in the main plugin ask and it can be added as its own file to be copy and pasted in!
